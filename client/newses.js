His mother Nigar moves the oxygen pipe away from his nose and puts a finger below his nostrils to check if she can feel him breathing. She begins to cry as she realises her son is fading. At this hospital in Afghanistan, there is not a single working ventilator. Mothers hold oxygen tubes near their babies' noses because masks designed to fit their small faces are not available, and the women are trying to fill in for what trained staff or medical equipment should do. Every day, 167 children die in Afghanistan from preventable diseases, according to the UN children's fund Unicef - illnesses that could and should be cured with the right medication. It is a staggering number. But it's an estimate. And when you step inside the paediatric ward of the main hospital in the western province of Ghor, you will be left wondering if that estimate is too low. Multiple rooms are full of sick children, at least two in each bed, their little bodies ravaged by pneumonia. Just two nurses look after 60 children. In one room, we saw at least two dozen babies who appeared to be in a serious condition. The children should have been continuously monitored in critical care - impossible at this hospital. Yet, for the million people who live in Ghor, this basic facility is still the best equipped public hospital they can access."

        There are chants of "Kilicdaroglu is the hope of the people". Many in the crowd are young. Five million Turks will vote for the first time in this election.
        
        At 15, Oguz is too young to go to the polls but couldn't stay away from the rally. "He is a good person, and he sees the future positively. If he becomes president our economy will rise up, and we will rise up."
        
        Mr Kilicdaroglu told me before the rally he would reorient Turkey, and prioritise relations with the West, not the Kremlin.
        
        "We want to become a part of the civilized world," he said. "We want free media and complete judicial independence. Erdogan does not think that way. He wants to be more authoritarian. The difference between us and Erdogan is the difference between black and white." But will Recep Tayyip Erdogan go quietly if he is defeated after 20 years in power, first as prime minister and now all-powerful president?

        "We will retire him, and send him to his corner," said Mr Kilicdaroglu. "He will step back quietly. No one should have any concerns about it."
        
        Others aren't so sure. There are indications that the Turkish leader may be preparing to dispute the result if he loses. Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu has warned the vote will be "a coup attempt by the West".
        
        Mr Kilicdaroglu said the combined opposition would be vigilant, trusting neither the president, "nor his Supreme Election Council nor his judges".`

        description: `On Wednesday, a 13-year-old entered the school, armed with two guns and a "kill list" - and shot dead eight fellow students and a security guard. Six other children remain in hospital.

        The school is at the heart of this central Belgrade community, where streams of mourners are arriving, bearing flowers and soft toys.
        
        Exactly 24 hours after the worst school shooting in Serbian history, pupils from the next-door college stand along the street to stand in silence and remember those killed.
        
        "I am crushed," says final-year school student Alex Oborina, 19, beside some of the handwritten notes left on the pavement.
        
        "We have failed as a society because this is something that should not happen to a 13-year-old. He should not be grabbing a gun and going into his school and shooting his friends."
        
        Alex seems to echo the sentiment everyone here feels.
        
        "This is probably the worst thing that has ever happened in my life. We need to use this as a stepping stone to rebuild. " I ask if the suspect's age of 13 will make it even harder for Serbian society to come to terms with this attack because he is too young to face prosecution.

        "Whatever happened, even if he had been 18 or 19, justice would never have been served for those parents who lost their children."
        
        The boy was arrested by police immediately after the shooting. His father who legally owned both guns was also detained, as was his mother.
        
        His lawyer, Irina Borovic, says he has been interviewed by doctors and has now been taken to a Belgrade neurology and psychiatry clinic for children and youth.`

        Officials say the vaccine, named Arexvy by the manufacturer GSK, is a major breakthrough that will save many lives.
        
        It could be available to people over 60 within months, officials say.
        
        "Today's approval of the first RSV vaccine is an important public health achievement to prevent a disease which can be life-threatening," said Dr Peter Marks, who leads the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
        
        RSV is a respiratory illness that typically results in cold-like symptoms for adults, but can be dangerous for young children, the elderly, and those with underlying health conditions.
        
        On average, it kills 100-300 children under the age of 5 in the US every year, according to the CDC.
        
        It also kills about 6,000 to 10,000 adults over 65 annually, and causes between 60,000 to 120,000 hospital admissions.
        
        In severe cases it can cause bronchiolitis, which includes a build-up of inflammation in the lungs and trouble in breathing.
        
        The drug was over 60 years in the making, and is the first to win approval to prevent RSV anywhere in the world.
        
        A study by GSK, a UK-based firm, which was published in February found a vaccine efficacy of 82.6%.`

He was quickly followed by Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo, David Beckham and Robinho as Perez continued to flex his muscles by splashing the cash.

        Another wave of high-end purchases followed after Perez returned to the presidency in 2009: Cristiano Ronaldo, Kaka, Gareth Bale and James Rodriguez were among those recruited for massive fees, with Real determined to position themselves as the ultimate dream destination for any superstar with serious ambitions.
        
        But then something changed. After years of spending every summer chasing the biggest possible names, Real abruptly halted the Galacticos policy and started to focus their recruitment strategy on the world's most promising youngsters. Instead of signing football's biggest established stars, the club became intent upon snapping up the game's next stars. This shift in strategy - envisioned by Perez and long-serving right-hand man Jose Angel Sanchez, and executed by chief scout Juni Calafat - was necessitated by a recognition of new economic realities.

        After so many years of being untouchable in the transfer market, Real could no longer routinely compete with the limitless wealth of the 'petrodollar' clubs. So they looked for an alternative route to success.
        
        There would be the occasional exception - such as the ill-fated £100m move for Eden Hazard in 2019 and the ongoing pursuit of Kylian Mbappe - but Real largely stayed away from those major deals, instead scouring South America for teenagers who had the potential to make it big.`
